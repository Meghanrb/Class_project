So far, we have run our files through FASTQC & quality controlled them with TRIMMOMATIC (see SBATCH script for details). 
My reads are WTA1_1 & WTA1_2.

WTA1_1.fq.gz # of reads before trimming	21,098,941. per-base sequence content before (B) and after (G) trimming. Sequence duplication before 
cleaning (B) and after (G) trimming. Minor adaption contamination went away after cleaning.

WTA1_2.fq.gz# of reads before trimming	21,098,941. per-base sequence content before (B) and after (G) trimming. Sequence duplication before 
cleaning (B) and after (G) trimming. Minor adaption contamination went away after cleaning.

Used C. albicans SC5314 genome assembly (GCF_000182965.3) for alignment. To create index go to interactive node and then: bowtie2-build GCF_000182965.3.fna calb_indx

# of cleaned reads after trimmomatic: 20,171,629. # read pairs detected by bowtie2: 20,171,629. % aligned concordantly 1 time:

We have also aligned our sequences using Bowtie2.
